# CRIC-WS

This repository contains the prototype of the CRIC Ontology made with Protégé.

The ontology maps a subset of the  the Computing Resource Information Catalogue (CRIC) of WLCG.

The Datamodel of CRIC is complex and a direct mapping of the dataset to RDF is not advisable.

A Domain Mapping approach based on Mapping Master was used as a prototype implementation.
